HTTP status codes indicate the result of a client's request in a RESTful API. They are grouped into five categories:

1xx â€“ Informational
100 Continue â€“ Request received, continue sending.
101 Switching Protocols â€“ Server switching protocols.

2xx â€“ Success
200 OK â€“ Request successful (used for GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE).
201 Created â€“ Resource successfully created (used for POST).
204 No Content â€“ Request successful, but no response body (used for DELETE).
3xx â€“ Redirection

301 Moved Permanently â€“ Resource moved to a new URL.
302 Found â€“ Temporary redirection.
304 Not Modified â€“ Cached version of the resource is still valid.
4xx â€“ Client Errors

400 Bad Request â€“ Invalid request syntax or parameters.
401 Unauthorized â€“ Authentication required.
403 Forbidden â€“ Client does not have permission.
404 Not Found â€“ Resource does not exist.
405 Method Not Allowed â€“ HTTP method not supported on the resource.
429 Too Many Requests â€“ Client has sent too many requests (rate limiting).
5xx â€“ Server Errors

500 Internal Server Error â€“ Generic server failure.
502 Bad Gateway â€“ Server received an invalid response from an upstream server.
503 Service Unavailable â€“ Server is temporarily overloaded or down.
504 Gateway Timeout â€“ Upstream server did not respond in time.

Each status code helps API clients understand the outcome of their request. ðŸš€
