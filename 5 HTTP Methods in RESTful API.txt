In RESTful API development, the five primary HTTP methods are:

GET â€“ Retrieves data from the server. It is safe and idempotent, meaning it does not change the resource state.

Example: GET /users/1 retrieves user details with ID 1.
POST â€“ Sends data to the server to create a new resource.

Example: POST /users with a request body creates a new user.
PUT â€“ Updates or replaces an existing resource. It is idempotent.

Example: PUT /users/1 updates the user with ID 1.
PATCH â€“ Partially updates an existing resource.

Example: PATCH /users/1 with a request body updates specific fields of user 1.
DELETE â€“ Removes a resource from the server.

Example: DELETE /users/1 deletes the user with ID 1.
These methods help in building a structured and scalable RESTful API. ðŸš€
